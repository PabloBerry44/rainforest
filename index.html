            <h2>Rainforests are being destroyed</h2>
            <p>According to analysis of satellite data, tropical forests are being destroyed at a rate of at least 8 million hectares or 31,000 square miles a year. That's an area the size of the state of South Carolina or the Czech Republic that is chopping down every year. Brazil, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Malaysia had the highest rates of rainforest loss between 2012 and 2014 according to research by Matt Hansen of the University of Maryland.
            Virtually all deforestation is driven by human activity. The biggest drivers of deforestation are agriculture — both industrial and subsistence — and cattle ranching. Much of this production is not consumed locally — instead it is sent to cities or overseas. That means consumers who may live far away from rainforests are usually at least partly responsible for the destruction of these beautiful and important landscapes. 
            In 2021 deforestation topped 13,000 square kilometers for the first time since 2006.</p>
