<h1><a href="https://pabloberry44.github.io/rainforest/">Rainforest</a></h1>
<p>Single page website about rainforests and deforestation. My main goal was to create some Javascript animations triggered on scroll. Some animations like those on top of the page in the hero section are disabled for mobile devices as they were laggy. This website looks best on desktop with all animations enabled. There is a parallax scrolling effect in the middle of the page made with Javascript. Close to the footer user can see short typing animation that is triggered when section appears in the viewport.</p>
